        <h1>Hi! I'm Alex.</h1>
        <p>A <strong>content marketer who codes</strong> based in Shoreditch, East London.</p>

    <div class="about">
        <p class="biig">I‚Äôm a full stack JavaScript developer that now works on marketing. Yes, that is right! I
            turned to the
            <span>dark side</span>.
        </p>
        <p>I work remotely at Scrimba where we‚Äôre building the future of online coding education. As Content Lead, I
            am responsible for SEO content strategy and supporting the content team. I also make YouTube videos and
            host The Scrimba Podcast.</p>
        <p>Before Scrimba, I worked as a Marketing Lead at a seed stage API company called CometChat.</p>
        <p>Before CometChat, I spent 2.5 years working as a Developer Advocate at another API company called Pusher.
            We got acquired by MessageBird in 2020 üéâ</p>
        <p>I consider myself a generalist</p>

        <h2>Creating content developers love at scale is my speciality üöÄ</h2>
        <p class="biig">It must be the logical-thinking, bug-abhorring developer in me! I think about content
            marketing like a well-oiled machine that consistently outputs creative content that moves the needle.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, if you start coding a big project without plan you might regret it. I like to think carefully
            about what content we‚Äôre making, what the business impact will be, and how to get the absolute most out
            of our efforts. </p>
        <p>At the same time, experimentation keeps us learning and informs our next batch of plans.</p>
