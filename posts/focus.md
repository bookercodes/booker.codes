- Motivation
	- If I do not find the work meaningful, the tactics below are futile
	- If I am stressed, sad, tired, or tense, these tactics aren't going to help until I work through my feelings.
- Physiology
	- Sleep 8 hours and go to bed/wake up at a specific time 
	- Fast from 8 pm-midday
	- Avoid carb-heavy meals (especially breakfast) and refined sugars to regulate energy throughout the day 
	- Maintain good posture and core strength, or aches will eventually distract
	- Wait an hour or two before drinking coffee in the morning. Then drink tea. Generally, 2 cups maximum and never after 3 pm.
- Environment
	- Keep a tidy physical environment with mise en place
	- Keep a tidy digital environment, including folder systems, notes, Notion pages, bookmarks, tabs, windows
- Plan
	- Prioritise tasks with the Eisenhower method
	- Spend a suitable amount of time planning and researching before diving into work
	- Lean on a system to capture and organise information as I go - for example, if I stumble upon an interesting article, I save it in Readwise. If I have a fleeting thought, I capture it in Drafts for later
- Work
	- If needed, negotiate a 25 minute focus timer to settle into tasks 
	- Work in 90 minute intervals
	- Remember to recharge between intervals - for example, [NSDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgytx8CBwH8), a walk in the sun, phoning a friend, or playing with the dog
	- Work with noise-canceling headphones on to eliminate outside distractions
- Avoiding distractions
	- I turn DnD on my iPhone but also configure it to allow time-sensitive notifications like login and bank alerts
	- Disallow most apps from sending notifications at all - for example, Amazon or even email (Amazon just want me to spend money and I will tackle email in a batch)
	- No work email or work Slack on my phone unless I am out and about during work hours for any reason 
	- Hide feeds and comments with the [Hide Feed](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-feed/nfnpeneopnjggmcfdkhpjefammeonpjk?hl=en) Chrome extension ($5/month)
- When I am stuck
	- Work on something "easier" to regain momentum
	- Boost my energy with coffee and a cake üç∞
	- Breathe 
	- Fidget my leg
	- Change the music. For example, lo-fi sends me to sleep in the evening, so I play house mixes on YouTube instead
- Avoid anything that depletes energy
	- Even though flicking through TikTok, Twitter, or HN sounds relaxing, it does not rejuvenate me. I would be much more rested if I did some push-ups or walked the dog
