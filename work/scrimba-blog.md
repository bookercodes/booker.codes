Scrimba is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

[The Scrimba blog](https://scrimba.com/articles) publishes guidance on how to learn to code and get your first web developer job. 

🔗 Jump to [**case study & business impact**](#case-study)

As Scrimba's first marketer, I launched the blog in June 2022. In the 8 months since, we have published more than 70 best-in-class posts and rank highly for keywords impactful to Scrimba's business. In January 2023, organic traffic grew 60% MoM compared to December 2022.

## Key accomplishments
I started the Scrimba blog from scratch in 2022. Here are my key accomplishments to date,

- 🏆 Write or edit 70 best-in-class posts enriched with custom illustrations, embedded videos, and interactive code examples
- 🏆 Go viral on dev.to
- 🏆 Establish team of freelance writers
- 🏆 Develop robust processes around the content calendar
- 🏆 Grow organic traffic 60% MoM

## Responsibilities

As Content Lead, it's my responsibility to

- Plan the strategic direction of our content efforts to reach thousands of learner developers a month through organic evergreen content
- Research thoughtful outlines based on keyword data that target a range of keywords while still putting the searcher's problem first
- Repurpose 100% of our content across LinkedIn and Twitter by extracting insights, quotes, and graphics
- Syndicate all posts on industry-leading publications like Hashnode and dev.to and consistently make their newsletters
- Collaborated with a designer to develop a recognizable brand for our post headers and custom illustrations
- Cary out technical SEO improvements based on industry trends and updates from Google
- Monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary
- Adapt a template to code and deploy the Scrimba blog website myself

## Case study

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, I wore multiple hats, including "Community Manager." 

As I huddled with students, I heard the same questions again and again (and again!):

- What programming language should I learn first?
- How long will it take?
- Should I learn React?
- (More recently) Will AI like ChatGPT make programming redundant?

Rather than answering every question one on one, I identified an **unfair advantage**:

> Scrimba students are vocal about their problems. We can address these pre-validated topics with written content and reach new customers.

It started with me researching and writing my own posts. Over time, I bought on freelance writers.

8 months later, we are now ranking for some high-value keywords and are still climbing!

## Scrimba's content strategy in 4 steps

To understand my approach to content stratey, here are the 4 steps I took with Scrimba. I don't mind sharing it because success lies in the execution.

🔗 **Need help with your content strategy? [Get in touch](mailto:booker@booker.codes)**

1. Identify topic clusters impactful for the business
2. Create high-caliber and engaging content
3. On-page technical SEO optimization
4. Content refresh

### Identify topic clusters impactful to the business

Scrimba has a bunch of courses covering a range of technologies. With such a broad range of courses, it could have been easy to write a bit about this,a bit about that, and spread ourselves thin. 

Instead, I elected to focus on pillar pages and topic clusters I believed to be most relevant to Scrimba's business  

// graphic showing learn web development content pillar

> **A lesson learned** Going back to the blog's origin story for a moment, a lot of learners asked, "how do I get a job?" 

> We created a lot of content around this topic, but it did not convert very well. Why?

> I learned leaners looking for career advice probably don't need a beginner course and were unlikely to convert. Besides, we were also competing with Indeed, GlassDoor, and other websites which Google perceive to be more authoratative on this subject. 

> That's when I pivoted to the `learn web development` vertical, where the learning continued! 

### Create high-caliber and engaging content

Content around how to learn to code is competitive. 

We aren't only competing with coding bootcamps, but with websites like HubSpot, who have cemented their authority on this subject over a decade as well.

To rank successfully, **our content has to more effectively satisfy the readers' needs** - it has to be more deeply researched, more visual, and more orientated around the learner web developer persona.

How we achieve this is partly documented in the official [Scrimba style guide](https://scrimba.com) I wrote but here are some of the most important points.

- Assure the reader of their problem 
- Make the post easy to scan
- Add interactive and rich embeds
- Do not self-promote or be too indulgent 

### On-page technical SEO optimizations
 

From a technical perspective, it is my responsibility to ensure the Scrimba blog has healthy web vitals and is free from any crawl, schema, HTTPs, etc. errors.

Additionally, I sought opportunities to improve our chance of ranking through technical SEO tactics: 

- I added writer bios to improve EAT
- Edited posts to answer questions in an NLP-friendly way, giving us a better chance to rank in a featured SERP
- Wrote summaries
- Compressed images and made sure they had keyword-friendly file names and helpful alt text

There's more to share, but I am still mastering technical SEO. Please [get in touch](mailto:booker@booker.codes) if you'd like to geek out about it with me! 

> **Believe it or not**, Scrimba didn't have a blog when I joined.

> I spun up an EC2 instance with Ghost, adapted a CSS template to match the Scrimba brand and setup tracking.

> The nice thing about knowing how to code is that I've never had to ask for help installing GTM 😅!

### Content refresh
It's the nature of the web. Even in the short 8 months I've been working on the blog, competitors have seen and one-upping it. Search intent can also change, so content we wrote 8 months ago might not be in the right format for today. 

As part of my responsibility as Content Lead, I monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary.

And that's about it! Those are the 4 steps to creating a top-ranking blog. Well, in _theory_ anyway. Success lies in the execution!

## Scaling the process
With a solid content strategy and some key learnings under my belt, I sought help from freelance writers in my network and moved into an editorial-type role.

I created an editorial process revolving around a Notion kanban board:

I also wrote and maintained a style guide, moving it forward with every revision. I try not to share the same feedback twice and update the style guide instead.

At the time of writing, I am in the process of supporting our most experienced writers to complete peer reviews. 

## Systematic content repurposing

It's pretty obvious frmo this case study, the Scrimba blog is longerm investment in organic as an acquisiton channel. At the same, we don't want to leave short-term gains on the table.

Everything we write on the Scrimba blog is syndicated on to popular websites in our industry (hashnode.com and dev.to) with canonical links. There, we often make newsletters and homepages. 

Additionally, a piece of content isn't really considered "done" until it's remixed in some way for social media. That could be a quote graphic, thread, or custom illustration, as illustrated below:
