Scrimba is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

[The Scrimba Blog](https://scrimba.com/articles) publishes guidance on how to learn to code and get your first web developer job.

As Scrimba's first marketer, I officially launched the blog in June 2022. In the 8 months since, we have published more than 70 best-in-class posts and rank highly for keywords impactful to Scrimba's business. In January 2023, organic traffic grew 60% MoM compared to December 2022.

## Key accomplishments
I started the Scrimba blog from scratch in 2022. Here are my key accomplishments to date,

- 🏆 Write or edit 70 best-in-class posts enriched with custom illustrations, embedded videos, and interactive code examples
- 🏆 Planned the strategic direction of our content efforts to reach thousands of learner developers a month through organic evergreen content
- 🏆 Research thoughtful outlines based on keyword data that target a range of keywords while still putting the searcher's problem first
- 🏆 Source, onboard, and support freelance technical writers to create awesome content our readers love
- 🏆 Adapt a template to code and deploy the Scrimba Blog website myself
- 🏆 Repurpose 100% of our content across LinkedIn and Twitter by extracting insights, quotes, and graphics
- 🏆 Syndicate all posts on industry-leading publications like Hashnode and dev.to and consistently make their newsletters
- 🏆 Collaborated with a designer to develop a recognizable brand for our post headers and custom illustrations
- 🏆 Cary out technical SEO improvements based on industry trends and updates from Google
- 🏆 Monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary

## Case study

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, I wore multiple hats, including "Community Manager." 

As I huddled with students, I heard the same questions again and again and again:

- What programming language should I learn?
- How long will it take?
- Should I learn React?
- (More recently) Will AI take my job??

Rather than answering every question one on one, I identified an **unfair advantage** for Scrimba:

> Scrimba students are vocal about their problems. We can address these validated topics with written content and reach new customers. 

8 months later, we are now ranking for some high-value keywords and continuing to climb!

## How to build a top-ranking blog in 4 steps

Scrimba has a tonne of beloved courses that cover a range of technologies. With such a broad range of courses, it would have been easy to write a bit about this and that and spread ourselves too thin. 

Instead, I elected to focus on verticals (content pillars) I believed to be most relevant to Scrimba's business. 

Here's how I built a top-ranking blog in 4 steps.

1. Top-tier content
2. On-page technical SEO optimization
3. Creating content around specific verticals
4. Content refresh

### Top-tier content

Content around how to learn to code is competitive. We aren't only competing with coding boot camps but with websites like HubSpot, who have cemented their authority on this subject over a decade as well.

**Our content had to be better**. It has to more effectively satisfy the readers' needs - more deeply researched, more visual, and more orientated around the learner web developer persona.

How did we achieve this?

- Assure the reader of their problem 
- Make the post easy to scan
- Add interactive and rich embeds
- Do not self-promote or be too indulgent 

### On-page technical SEO optimizations
 
Believe it or not, Scrimba didn't have a blog when I joined.

I spun up an EC2 instance with Ghost, adapted a CSS template to match the Scrimba brand and setup tracking. The nice thing about knowing how to code is that I've never had to ask for help installing Google Tag Manager 😅!

From a technical perspective, it is my responsibility to ensure the Scrimba blog has healthy web vitals and is free from any crawl, schema, HTTPs, etc. errors.

Additionally, I sought opportunities to improve our chance of ranking through technical SEO tactics: 

- I added writer bios to improve EAT
- Edited posts to answer questions in an NLP-friendly way, giving us a better chance to rank in a featured SERP
- Wrote summaries
- Compressed images and made sure they had keyword-friendly file names and helpful alt text

There's more to share, but I am still mastering technical SEO. Please [get in touch](mailto:booker@booker.codes) if you'd like to geek out about it with me! 

## Creating content around verticals

Rather than diluting our efforts, I orchestrated content around three verticals: 

- Career advise for juniors 
- Learn web development
- Learn react

It has been wildly successful!

> **A lesson learned**
> Maybe it's the developer in me. I like to take an experiment-driven approach to content. That means starting small but dreaming big, coming up with a hypothesis and trying to prove it before doubling down. 

> My first hypothesis failed.

> Going back to the blog's origin story, a lot of learned asked, "How to get a job?" 

> We created a lot of content around this, but it did not convert! Why?

> Learning 💡: Students looking for career advice probably don't need beginner courses. That's when we pivoted to the learn web development vertical, where the learning continued! 

## Content refresh
In the short 8 months I've been working on the blog, I've noticed competitors looking at our content and one-upping it. Search intent can also change, so content we wrote 8 months ago might not be in the right format for today. 

As part of my responsibility as Content Lead, I monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary.

There you have it! Those are the 4 steps to creating a top-ranking blog. It's now a question of execution.

## Scaling the process
With a solid content strategy and some key learnings under my belt, I sought help from freelance writers in my network and moved into an editorial-type role. 

I created an editorial process revolving around a Notion kanban board:

I also wrote and maintained a style guide, moving it forward with every revision.

At the time of writing, I am in the process of supporting our most experienced writers to complete peer reviews. 

## Systematic content repurposing

It's important to combine long-term SEO efforts with short-term content promotion.

Everything we write on the Scrimba blog is syndicated on to popular websites in our industry (hashnode.com and dev.to) with canonical links. There, we often make newsletters and homepages. 

Additionally, a piece of content isn't really considered "done" until it's remixed in some way for social media. That could be a quote graphic, thread, or custom illustration, as illustrated below:
