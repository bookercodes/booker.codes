## The Project
When it comes to learning how to code, students are spoiled for choice. Great for students really! But for a coding course platform like Scrimba, it can be difficult to keep students subscribed, making it tricky to manage churn.

What to do?

Well, Scrimba already had a beloved brand and a bunch of successful students who actually got full-time jobs after completing Scrimba’s meaty Frontend Developer Career Path. 

Compared to competitors like Udemy, which have impersonal brands, I identified that successful Scrimba students are more willing to jump on a call, share their learnings, and probably rave about their experience with Scrimba a little bit. We could record those conversations and publish them as a podcast.

When you work with me, every marketing project starts with a hypothesis that we’ll try to prove before doubling down.

Here’s the hypothesis that started the Scrimba podcast, 

- By highlighting successful students, we will encourage students to stick at Scrimba for longer and reduce churn
- By highlighting successful students, we will assure prospective students Scrimba is a great platform and increase conversions

Later, I started interviewing experts and alternating every week:

- By interviewing exports, their advice will make students more likely to succeed
- By interviewing exports, they will promote the clips and put SCrimba in front of more users, elevate the brand, and maybe even acquire a few new users when they’re ready to learn to code

Now, at this point I had never made a podcast before but I knew I could figure that out. 

In the early days, I recorded on my laptop microphone and edited the episode myself in Adobe Premiere. The challenge with these things tends to be getting people to "tune in" and keep coming back. Eventually, I landed on a niche that seemed to resonate:

> Hello, and welcome to the Scrimba Podcast. On this weekly show, I interview successful developers about their advice on how to learn to code and get a job. 

Once I felt confident in the format the pod got some traction (about 400 downloads a month) and positive feedback, I proposed we hire an editor. 

I suggested this would enable us to take the episode quality to the next level, publish consistently (we haven’t missed a week in 60 weeks), and free me up to do what I was really good at, which is leverage my skill set to get projects off the ground (you can read more about how I reignited the Scrimba YouTube channel here.)

My editor and I worked together to make the format as good as it can possibly be and I developed a set of principles to align by: 

1. Make the episodes as short as possible, but no shorter
2. Respect the listeners time 101%
3. Don’t promote Scrimba directly but let the guest do the talking (native ad)

I have to be honest!

Investing in an experienced podcast editor and transcripts was expensive but producing evergreen content paid off in a big way. 

Listeners are always telling us how they are listening through the backlog, and that is reflected in the analytics. 

Half our monthly downloads come from episodes published more than a month ago.  This compounding effect combined with word of mouth has been a major driver for growth.
