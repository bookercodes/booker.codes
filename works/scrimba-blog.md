## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

## What is the Scrimba blog?
[The Scrimba blog](https://scrimba.com/articles) publishes guidance on how to learn to code and get hired as a Junior web developer.

In my role as Content Lead, I launched the blog in June 2022. In the 8 months since, we have published more than 70 best-in-class posts and rank highly for keywords impactful to Scrimba's business. In January 2023, organic traffic grew **+80% MoM** compared to December 2022.

## The business problem

When I joined Scrimba as employee #2 in 2020, in typical startup fashion, I wore multiple hats, including "Community Manager" before bring promoted to Content Lead. 

As I helped students, I heard the same questions again and again (and again!):

- What programming language should I learn first?
- How long will it take?
- Should I learn React?
- (More recently) Will AI like ChatGPT make programming redundant?!?

Rather than answer every question one on one, I identified Scrimba's **unfair advantage**:

It started with me researching and writing my own posts. Over time, I bought on freelance writers.

8 months later, we are now ranking for some high-value keywords and climbing at a good pace!

To understand my approach to content strategy, here are the 4 broad steps I took with Scrimba. 

1. Identify topic clusters impactful for the business
2. Create high-caliber and engaging content
3. On-page technical SEO optimization
4. Refresh content as necessary
