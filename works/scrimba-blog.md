## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

## What is the Scrimba blog?
[The Scrimba blog](https://scrimba.com/articles) publishes guidance on how to learn to code and get hired as a Junior web developer.

In my role as Content Lead, I launched the blog in June 2022. In the 8 months since, we have published more than 70 best-in-class posts and rank highly for keywords impactful to Scrimba's business. In January 2023, organic traffic grew **+80% MoM** compared to December 2022.

## Case study

### Why did we start the Scrimba blog?

When I joined Scrimba as employee #2 in 2020, I wore multiple hats, including "Community Manager." 

As I huddled with students, I heard the same questions again and again (and again!):

- What programming language should I learn first?
- How long will it take?
- Should I learn React?
- (More recently) Will AI like ChatGPT make programming redundant?!?

Rather than answer every question one on one, I identified Scrimba's **unfair advantage**:

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-hypothesis.png)

It started with me researching and writing my own posts. Over time, I bought on freelance writers.

8 months later, we are now ranking for some high-value keywords and still climbing!

### How did you approach content strategy?

To understand my approach to content strategy, here are the 4 broad steps I took with Scrimba. 

1. Identify topic clusters impactful for the business
2. Create high-caliber and engaging content
3. On-page technical SEO optimization
4. Refresh content as necessary

Let's break it down.

#### Step 1. Identify topic clusters impactful to the business

Scrimba has a bunch of courses covering a range of technologies, from React and Angular to focused libraries like Tailwind. 

With such a broad range of courses, it could have been easy to write a bit about this, a bit about that, and spread ourselves thinner than the last bits of marmalade in the jar:

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-essentialism.png)

Instead, I elected to focus on pillar pages and topic clusters I believed had the best chance to drive revenue for Scrimba in the long run. For example, `how to become a web developer` (1900).

From here, I used a combination of qualitative and quantitative data (and a sprinkle of intuition) to arrive at topic clusters.

Here's one example of from the Scrimba blog:

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-web-development-cluster.png)

<div class="callout">
<h6>A lesson learned</h6>
<p>Going back to the blog's origin story for a moment, a lot of learners asked, "how do I get a job?"</p>

<p>I created a lot of content around this topic, but it did not convert very well. Why?</p>

<p>Scrimba mainly offer beginner courses. I learned leaners at this stage don't need beginner courses and were unlikely to convert.</p>

<p>Besides, we were competing with Indeed, GlassDoor, and other websites who have much better data and stories to tell around these subjects instead of focusing on our own advantages.</p

<p>That's when I pivoted to the <code>learn web development</code> vertical, where we address questions learners have at the <em>beginning</em> of their journey.</p>
</div>

#### Step 2. Create high-caliber and engaging content

Content around how to learn to code is pretty darn competitive. Not "mothers day gift ideas" competitive, but competitive nonetheless.

We aren't only competing with coding bootcamps, but with websites like W3Schools and HubSpot, who have cemented their authority on this subject over a decade. 

To rank successfully, **our content has to more effectively satisfy the readers' needs** - it has to be more deeply researched, more visual, and more orientated around the learner web developer persona.

How we achieve this is partly documented in the official [Scrimba style guide](https://www.notion.so/Style-guide-5223ffc0d7624779942d8bada50e10f7) and reflected in our latest posts.

One advantage we leaned on to beat the competition is the Scrimba Podcast, which I host. After transcribing more than 100 episodes, we could always find an authoritative SME to cite in a pinch. 

Another is the YouTube channel. Embedding videos increases dwell time.

#### Step 3. On-page technical SEO optimizations
 

From a technical perspective, it is my responsibility to ensure the Scrimba blog has healthy web vitals and is free from any crawl, schema, HTTPs, etc. errors.

Additionally, I sought opportunities to improve our chance of ranking through technical SEO tactics: 

- Structure internal links. For example, using the reverse content silo structure
- Write answers in an NLP-friendly way, giving us a better chance to feature in the SERP
- Resize and compress images. Ensure images have keyword-friendly file names and genuinely helpful `alt` text

#### Step 4. Refresh content as necessary
When I set out to write the content brief for a new post, I must confess - I look at posts competing for the same keyword to one up them.

The funny thing is, when our content starts to rank, our competitors will one up us yet. It's the nature of the web and SEO. Search intent can also change, so content we wrote 8 months ago might not be in the right format for today. 

As part of my responsibility as Content Lead, I monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary.

And that's about it! Those are the 4 steps to creating a top-ranking blog. Well, in _theory_ anyway. Success lies in the execution!

### Scaling the process
With a solid content strategy and some key learnings under my belt, I sought help from freelance writers in my network and gradually moved into an editorial-type role. 


![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-team.png)
I created an editorial process revolving around a Notion kanban board:

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-content-tracker.png)
I also wrote and maintained a style guide, moving it forward with every revision. I try not to share the same feedback twice and update the style guide instead.

At the time of this writing, I am in the process of supporting our most experienced writers to complete peer reviews to remove myself as a bottleneck and publish more top posts every month.

### Systematic content repurposing

SEO is a long-term investment and can take a while to pay off. At the same time, I don't want to leave short-term gains on the table.

Everything we write on the Scrimba blog is syndicated on to popular websites in our industry (hashnode.com and dev.to) with canonical links. There, we often make newsletters and homepages. 

Additionally, we don't consider a post truly "done" until it's adapted in some way for social media. That could be a quote graphic, thread, or custom illustration, as illustrated below:
