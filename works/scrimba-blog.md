Scrimba is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

[The Scrimba blog](https://scrimba.com/articles) publishes guidance on how to learn to code and get hired as a Junior web developer.

In my role as Content Lead, I launched the blog in June 2022. In the 8 months since, we have published more than 70 best-in-class posts and rank highly for keywords impactful to Scrimba's business. In January 2023, organic traffic grew **+80%** MoM compared to December 2022.

## Key accomplishments and responsibilities
I started the Scrimba blog from scratch in 2022. Here are my key accomplishments to date,

- 🏆 Oversaw the publication of 70 best-in-class posts enriched with custom illustrations, embedded videos, and interactive code examples
- 🏆 Attained top-ranking positions for keywords highly relevant to Scrimba's business. Increased organic traffic 80% MoM
- 🏆 Teamed up with an agency to successfully repurpose content for Twitter and LinkedIn. Increase traffic to the blog from social X% MoM
- 🏆 Sourced and onboarded a team of talented and motivated SEO writers who are also technical 
- 🏆 Collaborated with Scrimba's in-house designer to establish a distinct and eye-catching brand identity for the Scrimba blog. Adapted a template and launched the SEO-optimised blog

As Content Lead, it's my responsibility to

- Plan the strategic direction of our content efforts to reach thousands of learner developers a month through organic evergreen content
- Monitor and measure key metrics and evaluate how content is performing, refreshing content when necessary
- Research thoughtful outlines based on keyword data that target a range of keywords while still putting the searcher's problem first. Critically and effectively analyse the scope and potential business impact of new posts
- Research and test new content formats and channels to increase brand awareness and attract new students to Scrimba's courses
- Syndicate every bit of content on industry-leading publications like Hashnode and dev.to, and consistently make their newsletters
- Cary out technical SEO improvements based on industry trends and updates from Google
- Hire, coordinate, and support freelance SEO writers who are also technical. Prooread, edit, and suggest improvements to their work


## Case study

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, I wore multiple hats, including "Community Manager." 

As I huddled with students, I heard the same questions again and again (and again!):

- What programming language should I learn first?
- How long will it take?
- Should I learn React?
- (More recently) Will AI like ChatGPT make programming redundant?!?

Rather than answer every question one on one, I identified Scrimba's **unfair advantage**:

> Scrimba students are vocal about their problems. We can address these pre-validated topics with written content. Chances are, learners who haven't encountered Scrimba yet have the same queries! We can reach new customers.

It started with me researching and writing my own posts. Over time, I bought on freelance writers.

8 months later, we are now ranking for some high-value keywords and still climbing!

## Scrimba's content strategy in 4 steps

To understand my approach to content stratey, here are the 4 steps I took with Scrimba. Honestly, it's not a secret! Every SEO knows success lies in the execution.

1. Identify topic clusters impactful for the business
2. Create high-caliber and engaging content
3. On-page technical SEO optimization
4. Content refresh

### Identify topic clusters impactful to the business

Scrimba has a bunch of courses covering a range of technologies, from React and Angular to focused libraries like Tailwind. 

With such a broad range of courses, it could have been easy to write a bit about this, a bit about that, and spread ourselves thin. 

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-essentialism.png)

Instead, I elected to focus on pillar pages and topic clusters I believed to be most relevant to Scrimba's business, such as `how to become a web developer` (1900):

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-web-development-cluster.png)

> **A lesson learned** Going back to the blog's origin story for a moment, a lot of learners asked, "how do I get a job?" 

> We created a lot of content around this topic, but it did not convert very well. Why?

> I learned leaners looking for career advice probably don't need a beginner course and were unlikely to convert. Besides, we were also competing with Indeed, GlassDoor, and other websites which better data story telling and who Google perceive to be more authoratative on this subject. It would be better to focus on our advantages.

> That's when I pivoted to the `learn web development` vertical, where we achieved greater succes and the learning continues!

### Create high-caliber and engaging content

Content around how to learn to code is pretty darn competitive. Not "how to lose weight" competitive, but competitive nonetheless.

We aren't only competing with coding bootcamps, but with websites like W3Schools and HubSpot, who have cemented their authority on this subject over a decade. 

To rank successfully, **our content has to more effectively satisfy the readers' needs** - it has to be more deeply researched, more visual, and more orientated around the learner web developer persona.

How we achieve this is partly documented in the official [Scrimba style guide](https://www.notion.so/Style-guide-5223ffc0d7624779942d8bada50e10f7) and reflected in the posts.

### On-page technical SEO optimizations
 

From a technical perspective, it is my responsibility to ensure the Scrimba blog has healthy web vitals and is free from any crawl, schema, HTTPs, etc. errors.

Additionally, I sought opportunities to improve our chance of ranking through technical SEO tactics: 

- Write answers in an NLP-friendly way, giving us a better chance to rank in a featured SERP
- Compress images and made sure they had keyword-friendly file names and helpful alt text

And there you have it!

> **Believe it or not** Scrimba didn't have a blog when I joined!

> I spun up a Digital Ocean droplet with Ghost, adapted a CSS template to match the Scrimba brand and setup tracking.

> The nice thing about knowing how to code is that haven't needed help installing Google Tag Manager yet 😅!

### Content refresh
When I set out to write a new post, I must confess - I look at posts competing for the same keyword to one up them.

The funny thing is, when our content starts to rank, they will one up us yet. It's the nature of the web and SEO. Search intent can also change, so content we wrote 8 months ago might not be in the right format for today. 

As part of my responsibility as Content Lead, I monitor and measure all SEO efforts, refreshing content when necessary.

And that's about it! Those are the 4 steps to creating a top-ranking blog. Well, in _theory_ anyway. Success lies in the execution!

## Scaling the process
With a solid content strategy and some key learnings under my belt, I sought help from freelance writers in my network and gradually moved into an editorial-type role. 


![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-team.png)
I created an editorial process revolving around a Notion kanban board:

![Scrimba blog alt text](../../img/scrimba-blog-content-tracker.png)
I also wrote and maintained a style guide, moving it forward with every revision. I try not to share the same feedback twice and update the style guide instead.

At the time of writing, I am in the process of supporting our most experienced writers to complete peer reviews. 

## Systematic content repurposing

It's pretty obvious frmo this case study, the Scrimba blog is longerm investment in organic as an acquisiton channel. At the same, we don't want to leave short-term gains on the table.

Everything we write on the Scrimba blog is syndicated on to popular websites in our industry (hashnode.com and dev.to) with canonical links. There, we often make newsletters and homepages. 

Additionally, a piece of content isn't really considered "done" until it's remixed in some way for social media. That could be a quote graphic, thread, or custom illustration, as illustrated below:
