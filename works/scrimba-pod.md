## What is Scrimba?

Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

## What is the Scrimba podcast?

[The Scrimba Podcast](https://scrimba.com/podcast) is a top-ranking technology podcast for aspiring coders looking to transition into tech. At the time of this writing, there are currently 103 episodes, generating **14,000+ downloads per month**.  

Here are some of my favourite episodes to give you a sense for what the show is all about. One week I interview a recently-hired Scrimba student. The next week, I interview an experienced professional about their career advice:

## Key accomplishments & responsibilities
I started the Scrimba podcast from scratch in 2020. Here are my key accomplishments to date,
 
- 🏆 103 episodes 
- 🏆 14,000+ downloads a month
- 🏆 Developed an engaging and evergreen format that keeps listeners coming back
- 🏆 Record Scrimba success stories that inspire students to convert to Scrimba and stick around for longer
- 🏆 Elevated Scrimba’s brand by positioning Scrimba alongside student’s favorite teachers and creators 
- 🏆 Hire and collaborate with a senior-level editor and producer
- 🏆 Developed a content repurposing strategy to remix recordings into short-form social media content
- 🏆 Adapt a template to code and deploy the Scrimba Podcast website myself

In my role as Content Lead, it's my responsibility to:

- Publish an episode every week (haven't missed a week in 89+ weeks)
- Source and reach out to my own guests
- Make newly-hired students who have never been on a podcast before feel comfortable and bring out the best in them

## The business problem
When it comes to learning how to code, students are spoiled for choice. Great for students really! But for a coding course platform like [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com), it can be tricky to keep students subscribed and manage churn.

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, Per (Scrimba CEO and co-founder) and I collaborated on a series of experiments to identify high impact initiatives to keep students engaged and reduce churn.

After running several experiments, I learned Scrimba students are more than willing to jump on a call, share their learnings, and probably rave about their experience with Scrimba a little bit 🕺🏻. That's when the epithany hit. **We could record those conversations as success stories and publish them as a podcast!**

The hypothesis went something like this,

All we had to do now was prove the hypotheses! There was just one problem...

I had no idea how to start a podcast.

## Solution: A podcast is born
Yeah, that's right. Another one!

Now, at this point I had never made a podcast before but I knew I could figure that out. 

For the first few episode, I recorded using my laptop microphone and edited the episodes myself in Adobe Premiere:

I don't think it was up to NPRs standards 😅! But it was _good enough_ to start learning and iterating on the positioning of the podcast.

A few months later, we arrived at a podcast elevator pitch and format that hooks our listeners:

My editor, Jan, and I collaborated closely to make the format as good as it can possibly be and develop an efficient workflow:

We haven't missed a weekly episode in 89+ weeks are still going strong!
