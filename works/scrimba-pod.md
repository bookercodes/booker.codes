Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

[The Scrimba Podcast](https://scrimba.com/podcast) is a top-ranking technology podcast for aspiring coders looking to transition into tech. At the time of this writing, there are currently 103 episodes, generating **14,000+ downloads per month**.  

Here are some of my favourite episodes to give you a sense for what the show is all about. One week I interview a recently-hired Scrimba student. The next week, I interview an experienced professional about their career advice:

## Key accomplishments & responsibilities
I started the Scrimba podcast from scratch in 2020. Here are my key accomplishments to date,
 
- 🏆 103 episodes 
- 🏆 14,000+ downloads a month
- 🏆 Developed an engaging and evergreen format that keeps listeners coming back
- 🏆 Record Scrimba success stories that inspire students to convert to Scrimba and stick around for longer
- 🏆 Elevated Scrimba’s brand by positioning Scrimba alongside student’s favorite teachers and creators 
- 🏆 Hire and collaborate with a senior-level editor and producer
- 🏆 Developed a content repurposing strategy to remix recordings into short-form social media content
- 🏆 Adapt a template to code and deploy the Scrimba Podcast website myself

In my role as Content Lead, it's my responsibility to:

- Publish an episode every week (haven't missed a week in 89+ weeks)
- Source and reach out to my own guests
- Make newly-hired students who have never been on a podcast before feel comfortable and bring out the best in them

## Case study
When it comes to learning how to code, students are spoiled for choice. Great for students really! But for a coding course platform like [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com), it can be tricky to keep students subscribed and manage churn.

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, Per (Scrimba CEO and co-founder) and I collaborated on a series of experiments to identify high impact initiatives to keep students engaged and reduce churn.

After running several experiments, I learned Scrimba students are more than willing to jump on a call, share their learnings, and probably rave about their experience with Scrimba a little bit 🕺🏻. That's when the epithany hit. **We could record those conversations as success stories and publish them as a podcast!**

The hypothesis went something like this,

All we had to do now was prove the hypotheses! There was just one problem...

I had no idea how to start a podcast.


### A podcast is born
Yeah, that's right. Another one!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">in my late 20’s which means time to start <br><br>⚪️a family<br><br>🔘a podcast</p>&mdash; david (@david_actually) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_actually/status/1047509702677069824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, at this point I had never made a podcast before but I knew I could figure that out. 

For the first few episode, I recorded using my laptop microphone and edited the episodes myself in Adobe Premiere:

I don't think it was up to NPRs standards 😅! But it was _good enough_ to start learning and iterating on the positioning of the podcast.

A few months later, we arrived at a podcast elevator pitch and format that hooks our listeners:

### Hiring an editor
Once the podcast got some traction and positive feedback, I proposed that we hire an experienced podcast editor. 

Did you know? [83% of podcasts eventually stop uploading and die out](https://podpros.com/5-main-reasons-podcasts-fail-and-how-you-can-overcome-each/#:~:text=There%20are%202.5%20million%20podcasts,in%20365%20days%20from%20now.), whereas the Scrimba podcast hasn't missed a week in over a year and is still going strong.

Bringing on an editor allowed us to publish consistently and make the podcast as good as it can be while I worked on other projects in my role as Content Lead (you can read more about [how I reignited the Scrimba YouTube channel here](https://booker.codes/works/scrimba-yt/).)

My editor, Jan, and I collaborated closely to make the format as good as it can possibly be and develop an efficient workflow:

We haven't missed a weekly episode in 89+ weeks are still going strong!

### Compounding effects of evergreen content 🌱
When we publish an episode of the Scrimba podcast, we aim to produce something that will still be relevant and interesting a year or more later. This commitment to evergreen topics and production quality has paid off in a big way.  

Listeners often post on Twitter to tell us they are working their way through the backlog. The same trend is reflected in our analytics. In fact, **half** our monthly downloads come from episodes published more than a month ago. 

This compounding effect has been one of two major drivers for listnership growth. 

The other driver of growth? Systematic content repurposing.

Let's take a closer look at how we leverage social media and shortform content to reach new listeners every month.

### Repurposing
For each episode, we comb through the transcript for the best moments and repurpose them into short form content such as clips, quotes, threads, or LinkedIn carousels:

Although we might share the same insight on differnet platforms, it's imperative we get the angle right. A great thread might not make a great LinkedIn carousel and so on.
