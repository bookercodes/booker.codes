Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

[The Scrimba Podcast](https://scrimba.com/podcast) is a top-ranking technology podcast for aspiring coders looking to transition into tech. At the time of this writing, there are currently 103 episodes, generating 14,000+ downloads per month.  

Here are some of my favourite episodes to give you a sense for what the podcast is all about,

## Key accomplishments & responsibilities
I started the Scrimba podcast from scratch in 2020. Here are my key accomplishments to date,
 
- 🏆 103 episodes 
- 🏆 14,000+ downloads a month
- 🏆 Developed an engaging and evergreen format that keeps listeners coming back
- 🏆 Record Scrimba success stories that inspire students to convert to Scrimba and stick around for longer
- 🏆 Elevated Scrimba’s brand by positioning Scrimba alongside student’s favorite teachers and creators 
- 🏆 Hire and collaborate with a senior-level editor and producer
- 🏆 Developed a content repurposing strategy to remix recordings into short-form content for social media
- 🏆 Adapt a template to code and deploy the Scrimba Podcast website myself

In my role as Content Lead and Host of the Scrimba Podcast, it's my responsibility to:

- Publish an episode every week without fail (haven't missed a week in 89 weeks)
- Source and reach out to my own guests
- Make newly-hired students who have never been on a podcast before feel comfortable and bring out the best in them

## Case study
When it comes to learning how to code, students are spoiled for choice. Great for students really! But for a coding course platform like [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com), it can be tricky to keep students subscribed and manage churn.

When I joined Scrimba in 2020, Per (Scrimba CEO and co-founder) and I collaborated on a series of experiments to identify high impact initiatives to keep students engaged and reduce churn.

After running several experiments, I learned Scrimba students are more than willing to jump on a call, share their learnings, and probably rave about their experience with Scrimba a little bit 🕺🏻. **We could record those conversations as success stories and publish them as a podcast!**

The hypothesis went something like this,

All we had to do now was prove the hypotheses! There was just one problem...

I had no idea how to start a podcast.


### A podcast is born
Yeah, that's right. Another one!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">in my late 20’s which means time to start <br><br>⚪️a family<br><br>🔘a podcast</p>&mdash; david (@david_actually) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_actually/status/1047509702677069824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, at this point I had never made a podcast before but I knew I could figure that out. 

For the first few episode, I recorded using my laptop microphone and edited the episodes myself in Adobe Premiere:

I don't think it was up to NPRs standards 😅, but it was _good enough_ to start learning and iterating on the positioning of the podcast. A few months later, we arrived at a format that piques our listeners:

### Hiring an editor
Once the podcast got some traction and positive feedback, I proposed we hire an experienced editor. 

Did you know? [70% of podcasts never make it past episode 10](https://podpros.com/5-main-reasons-podcasts-fail-and-how-you-can-overcome-each/#:~:text=There%20are%202.5%20million%20podcasts,in%20365%20days%20from%20now.).

Bringing on an editor would allow us to publish consistently and make the podcast as good as it can be while I worked on other projects in my role as Content Lead (you can read more about [how I reignited the Scrimba YouTube channel here](https://booker.codes/works/scrimba-yt/).)

My editor, Jan, and I collaborated closely to make the format as good as it can possibly be and develop an efficient workflow:

We haven't missed a weekly episode in 89+ weeks are still going strong!


### Compounding effects of evergreen content 🌱
Early on, we made a calculated decision to produce high quality and (hopefully) evergreen episodes. Investing in quality like this has paid off in a big way 😃.

Listeners are always telling us how they're listening through the backlog, and that is supported by our analytics. 

In fact, **half our monthly downloads come from episodes published more than a month ago**. This compounding effect combined with WoM has been one of two major drivers for listnership growth. 

The other driver of growth? Systematic content repurposing.

Let's take a closer look at how we leverage social media to grow the podcast.
