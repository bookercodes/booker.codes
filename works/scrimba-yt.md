## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

What makes Scrimba special is their mission to offer a bootcamp-like coding experience for the monthly price of a gym membership.

## What is the Scrimba YouTube?
On the [Scrimba YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/scrimba), I plan, write, record, and sometimes edit videos to help viewers learn to code. 

Apart from producing my own videos (you can watch some linked below!) my role is to support the team to be modern video creators as well.  For example, by offering advice on scripts and thumbnails, provisioning recording equipment, and facilitating professional video editing. 

As a team effort, **the Scrimba channel generated just shy of 1m views and 21K subscribers in the last 12 months!**

Here are some of my videos with the most views (and one personal favourite on the rise at the bottom!) to give you a sense for what the channel is all about:

- [How to Build a Junior Developer Portfolio That Will Get You Hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) (98K views)
- [Self-taught Web Developer Checklist 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zJExpDvxs) (71K views)
- [Angular vs React vs Vue: Which Framework to Learn in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2uKprwHHXU) (60K)
- [Mock React job interview with Cassidy Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV373VaS4UM) (40K)
- [A day in the life of a self-taught React developer in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBXoU-pHoo)

In my role as Content Lead, it’s my responsibility to:

- Support team to produce quality videos of their own. For example, by setting them up with recording equipment, facilitating the editing, coaching them to feel confident on camera, and offering my expertise on driving engagement on YouTube
- Efficiently adapt research from the [Scrimba blog](/works/scrimba-blog) or expert interviews on the [Scrimba pod](/works/scrimba-pod) to produce new videos
- Facilitate connections between the team and my previous guests on the Scrimba Podcast. For instance, connecting Leanne with guests for her frequent Ask an Expert stream
- Remix videos into short-form social media content (including YouTube shorts) when appropiate

- Report on impact to the founders monthly


## The business problem

Scrimba offers an interactive code screencast format that encourages learners to get hands-on and therefore better comprehend difficult coding concepts. This format is superior to traditional videos in every way, but not everyone has heard about the power of Scrimba yet. 

To reach new students and spread the word, we have to meet them where they’re at. Namely, on YouTube! 

Chances are, if someone is learning on YouTube, they enjoy learning with videos and will get along with Scrimba. This made YouTube a promising acquisiton channel from the beginning.

Further, Scrimba’s overarching mission is to offer the same experience as a $15K bootcamp for $30 a month. A bold mission by any measure!

At a bootcamp, you don’t “just” get the educational materials. You get mentorship, a community, and career advice as well. 

Bootcamps can offer this support to students because they hire expensive full-time TAs and career coaches. 

Connecting students and mentors one-on-one isn't something Scrimba can reasonably do at such low monthly price point. To fulfil our mission and strengthen product-market fit, we would have to find a different way to offer students support at scale.

That's where I come in 🙋🏻:

- P: For Scrimba to be a billion dollar business, we need to disrupt bootcamps
- P: We need to help students achieve the same outcome at scale
- P: There should be a weekly "pulse" like a bootcamp 
- A: On it boss

To help students achieve the same career sucess they could find at a bootcamp, I set out to produce top-tier videos that support existing students while also acquiring new ones with compelling title, thumbnails, and hooks. 

This initiative went beyond community and content marketing. It also involved collaborating with the product and product marketing teams to make videos part of the product experience.
