## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

What makes Scrimba special is their mission to offer a bootcamp-like coding experience for the monthly price of a gym membership.

## What is the Scrimba YouTube?
On the [Scrimba YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/scrimba), I plan, write, record, and sometimes edit videos to help viewers learn to code and get their first job in tech.

Apart from producing my own videos (you can watch some linked below!) my role is to support the team to be modern video creators as well.  For example, by offering advice on scripts and thumbnails, provisioning recording equipment, and facilitating professional video editing. 

As a team effort, **the Scrimba channel generated just shy of 1m views and 21K subscribers in the last 12 months!**

Here are some of my videos with the most views (and one personal favourite on the rise at the bottom!) to give you a sense of my work and what the Scrimba channel is all about:

- [How to Build a Junior Developer Portfolio That Will Get You Hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) (98K views)
- [Self-taught Web Developer Checklist 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zJExpDvxs) (71K views)
- [Angular vs React vs Vue: Which Framework to Learn in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2uKprwHHXU) (60K)
- [Mock React job interview with Cassidy Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV373VaS4UM) (40K)
- [A day in the life of a self-taught React developer in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBXoU-pHoo)

## The business problem

Scrimba offers an interactive code screencast format that encourages learners to get hands-on. This format is superior to traditional videos in every way, but not everyone has heard about the power of Scrimba yet. 

To reach new students and spread the word, we have to meet them where they‚Äôre at and that's YouTube! 

Chances are, if someone is learning on YouTube, they enjoy learning with videos and will get along with Scrimba. This made YouTube a promising acquisiton channel from the beginning.

Further, Scrimba‚Äôs overarching mission is to offer the same experience as a $15K bootcamp for $30 a month. A bold mission by any measure! 

At a bootcamp, you don‚Äôt ‚Äújust‚Äù get the educational materials. You get access to TAs and career coaches as well. This isn't something Scrimba can reasonably offer while only charging a few bucks a month. To fulfil this mission and strengthen product-market fit, Scrimba and I would have to find a different way to offer students support at scale.

To help students achieve the same career sucess they could find at a bootcamp, I set out to produce top-tier videos that support existing students while also acquiring new ones with compelling title, thumbnails, and hooks.
