## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

What makes Scrimba special is their mission to offer a bootcamp-like coding experience for the monthly price of a gym membership.

## What is the Scrimba YouTube?
On the [Scrimba YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/scrimba), I plan, write, record, and sometimes edit videos to help viewers learn to code. 

Apart from producing my own videos (you can watch some linked below!) my role is to support the team to be modern video creators as well.  For example, by offering advice on scripts and thumbnails, provisioning recording equipment, and facilitating professional video editing. 

As a team effort, **the Scrimba channel generated just shy of 1m views and 21K subscribers in the last 12 months!**

Here are some of my videos with the most views (and one personal favourite on the rise at the bottom!) to give you a sense for what the channel is all about:

- [How to Build a Junior Developer Portfolio That Will Get You Hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) (98K views)
- [Self-taught Web Developer Checklist 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zJExpDvxs) (71K views)
- [Angular vs React vs Vue: Which Framework to Learn in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2uKprwHHXU) (60K)
- [Mock React job interview with Cassidy Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV373VaS4UM) (40K)
- [A day in the life of a self-taught React developer in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBXoU-pHoo)

In my role as Content Lead, it’s my responsibility to:

- Support team to produce quality videos of their own. For example, by setting them up with recording equipment, facilitating the editing, coaching them to feel confident on camera, and offering my expertise on driving engagement on YouTube

- Report on impact to the founders monthly


## The business problem

Scrimba offers an interactive video format which helps learners get hands on, remember what they’re learning, and finally learn to code.

To reach new customers, we have to meet them where they’re at. Namely, YouTube!

Chances are, if someone is learning on YouTube, they enjoy learning with videos and will benefit from Scrimba. This made YouTube an attractive channel from the beginning.

Further, Scrimba’s overarching mission is to offer a boot camp-like experience at a fraction of the cost. 

Offering a $15K+ experience at $30 a month is a bold assignment. 

At a bootcamp, you don’t “just” get the educational materials. You get mentorship, community, and career advice as well. While bootcamps solve this problem with one on one mentorship, this isn't something Scrimba can reasonably offer at their affordable price point. **We needed an alternative more scalable way to sovle the same problem.**

That's where YouTube comes in.

In an attempt to address these problems at scale and strengthen  product market fit (PMF), I was tasked to produce top-tier videos that support students at scale, strengthen PMF, grow the brand, and attract new customers in the process.  By collaborating with internal marketnig and the product team, we found ways to make the videos part of the experience through product updates and email campaigns and stuff.
