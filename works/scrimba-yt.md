## What is Scrimba?
Scrimba (YC S20) is a coding course platform with over 120K monthly active students. It's based on a new video format that makes the screencasts fully interactive for students, and easier to create for teachers.

## What is the Scrimba YouTube?
On the [Scrimba YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/scrimba), I plan, write, record, and sometimes edit videos to help viewers learn to code. 

Apart from producing my own videos (you can watch some linked below!) my role is to support the team to be modern video creators as well.  For example, by offering advice on scripts and thumbnails, provisioning recording equipment, and facilitating professional video editing. 

As a team effort, **the Scrimba channel generated just shy of 1m views and 21K subscribers in the last 12 months!**

Here are some of my videos with the most views (and one personal favourite on the rise at the bottom!) to give you a sense for what the channel is all about:

- [How to Build a Junior Developer Portfolio That Will Get You Hired](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eMp8l4WEpE) (98K views)
- [Self-taught Web Developer Checklist 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zJExpDvxs) (71K views)
- [Angular vs React vs Vue: Which Framework to Learn in 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2uKprwHHXU) (60K)
- [Mock React job interview with Cassidy Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV373VaS4UM) (40K)
- [A day in the life of a self-taught React developer in London](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZBXoU-pHoo)
